# OVRMicrophone
A virtual spatialized microphone used to create live binaural audio playback in virtual reality.

This project page is dedicated for [Issues](https://github.com/OrendCross/OVRMicrophone/issues) tracking and future [Wiki](https://github.com/OrendCross/OVRMicrophone/wiki) guides for my closed-source personal-project OVRMicrophone.  I created this project because I wanted to learn more about the OpenVR Overlay API, with the hope of making VR ASMR content be more immersive for both creators and viewers.
